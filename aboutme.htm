<td colspan="4"> <font size="4"> My name is Hana Hadžo Mulaliæ. I am 22 years old. I am from Breza, the small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
However, I married the last summer, so I live in Sarajevo with my husband. I am studing Computer Sciences at International University of Sarajevo. 
On the picture, left, it is me in front my university in Sarajevo. Currently, 
I  am studying the forth year. Now, I am Erasmus + exchange student at Anadolu university in Eskisehir. Here, I will stay for 4 months. Eskisehir can bring me a lot of experience. 
Generally, I enjoy visiting and exploring new places. I have eaten Eskisehir traditional food, visited interesting places and shoppings and
I can advice to everyone to visit Eskisehir. Also, I met several kind people in Eskisehir - I am friendly person who like socializing. My favourite field in Computer sciene is math - everything related to it. I would like to teach the math.
In my high school, I played the voleyball, but I do not play more. 
Now, I like riding the bicycle and spending time in nature in green areas.
