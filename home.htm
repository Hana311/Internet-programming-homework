 <p> <font size ="4" face="italic">Eskisehir is a province of Turkey. It is known as the city with a massive university population.
 The flourishing of the city is associated with mayor Yilmaz Büyükerºen. He realised the potential of the city's Porsuk River,
 adding walking bridges and a sand beach, while building pedestrian thoroughfares and a smoothly efficient tram system.
 In summer you can even explore the Porsuk by gondola or boat. The cumulative result is Turkey’s most liveable city, and a place where you can engage with the kind locals.
 With an atmospheric old quarter, roaring nightlife, cultivated cuisine, two parks and a fascinating science centre for kids, Eskiºehir
 truly has much on offer. It is called "The City of the Pride".
